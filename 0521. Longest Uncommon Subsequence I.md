# 题目

Given two strings, you need to find the longest uncommon subsequence of this two strings. The longest uncommon subsequence is defined as the longest subsequence of one of these strings and this subsequence should not be **any** subsequence of the other string.

A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from one sequence by deleting some characters without changing the order of the remaining elements. Trivially, any string is a subsequence of itself and an empty string is a subsequence of any string.

The input will be two strings, and the output needs to be the length of the longest uncommon subsequence. If the longest uncommon subsequence doesn't exist, return -1.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: a = "aba", b = "cdc"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest uncommon subsequence is "aba", 
because "aba" is a subsequence of "aba", 
but not a subsequence of the other string "cdc".
Note that "cdc" can be also a longest uncommon subsequence.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: a = "aaa", b = "bbb"
Output: 3
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: a = "aaa", b = "aaa"
Output: -1
```

 

**Constraints:**

- Both strings' lengths will be between `[1 - 100]`.
- Only letters from a ~ z will appear in input strings.

## 我的思路

这题要找两个字符串其中一个字符串的子序列，而不是另一个字符串的子序列的最长值。我先用两个指针分别遍历两个字符串的方式写，提交了之后一直出现错误答案，想了半天，发现原来是脑筋急转弯：如果两个字符串不相同，那么其中任意一个字符串本身就是答案。因此，代码只简化成了一行：如果两个字符串不相同，返回较长的一个字符串长度；否则返回-1。

```python
class Solution:
    def findLUSlength(self, a: str, b: str) -> int:
        return max(len(a),len(b)) if a != b else -1
```
