# 题目

You are given a data structure of employee information, which includes the employee's **unique id**, their **importance value** and their **direct** subordinates' id.

For example, employee 1 is the leader of employee 2, and employee 2 is the leader of employee 3. They have importance value 15, 10 and 5, respectively. Then employee 1 has a data structure like [1, 15, [2]], and employee 2 has [2, 10, [3]], and employee 3 has [3, 5, []]. Note that although employee 3 is also a subordinate of employee 1, the relationship is **not direct**.

Now given the employee information of a company, and an employee id, you need to return the total importance value of this employee and all their subordinates.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [[1, 5, [2, 3]], [2, 3, []], [3, 3, []]], 1
Output: 11
Explanation:
Employee 1 has importance value 5, and he has two direct subordinates: employee 2 and employee 3. They both have importance value 3. So the total importance value of employee 1 is 5 + 3 + 3 = 11.
```

 

**Note:**

1. One employee has at most one **direct** leader and may have several subordinates.
2. The maximum number of employees won't exceed 2000.

## 我的思路

我用了一个字典dic来存储每个id及其属性，一个集合dic_id来存储需要计算importance的所有id。dic建立完成后，通过递归的方式将所有需要计算importance的id添加进集合dic_id中，最后根据该集合来检索所有id并计算importance。

```python
"""
# Definition for Employee.
class Employee:
    def __init__(self, id: int, importance: int, subordinates: List[int]):
        self.id = id
        self.importance = importance
        self.subordinates = subordinates
"""
class Solution:
    def getImportance(self, employees: List['Employee'], id: int) -> int:
        if not employees:
            return 0
        self.dic = {}
        self.dic_id = set([id])
        res = 0 
        for i in range(len(employees)):
            self.dic[employees[i].id] = employees[i]
        
        def add_id(id: int):
            self.dic_id.add(id)
            if not self.dic[id].subordinates:
                return
            for x in self.dic[id].subordinates:
                add_id(x)
                
        add_id(id)
        for x in self.dic_id:
            res += self.dic[x].importance
        return res
```
