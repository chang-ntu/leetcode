# 题目

A matrix is *Toeplitz* if every diagonal from top-left to bottom-right has the same element.

Now given an `M x N` matrix, return `True` if and only if the matrix is *Toeplitz*.
 

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
matrix = [
  [1,2,3,4],
  [5,1,2,3],
  [9,5,1,2]
]
Output: True
Explanation:
In the above grid, the diagonals are:
"[9]", "[5, 5]", "[1, 1, 1]", "[2, 2, 2]", "[3, 3]", "[4]".
In each diagonal all elements are the same, so the answer is True.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
matrix = [
  [1,2],
  [2,2]
]
Output: False
Explanation:
The diagonal "[1, 2]" has different elements.
```


**Note:**

1. `matrix` will be a 2D array of integers.
2. `matrix` will have a number of rows and columns in range `[1, 20]`.
3. `matrix[i][j]` will be integers in range `[0, 99]`.


**Follow up:**

1. What if the matrix is stored on disk, and the memory is limited such that you can only load at most one row of the matrix into the memory at once?
2. What if the matrix is so large that you can only load up a partial row into the memory at once?

## 我的思路

给一个矩阵，要求判断该矩阵中从左上到右下的斜线上的值是否都相等。我使用最简单粗暴的方法：双重循环来判断。

```python
class Solution:
    def isToeplitzMatrix(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        lm = len(matrix)
        ln = len(matrix[0])
        if lm==1:
            return True
        for i in range(ln-1):
            for j in range(lm-1):
                if matrix[j+1][i+1]!=matrix[j][i]:
                    return False
        return True   
```
