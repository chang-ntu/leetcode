# 题目

A rectangle is represented as a list `[x1, y1, x2, y2]`, where `(x1, y1)` are the coordinates of its bottom-left corner, and `(x2, y2)` are the coordinates of its top-right corner.

Two rectangles overlap if the area of their intersection is positive. To be clear, two rectangles that only touch at the corner or edges do not overlap.

Given two (axis-aligned) rectangles, return whether they overlap.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: rec1 = [0,0,2,2], rec2 = [1,1,3,3]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: rec1 = [0,0,1,1], rec2 = [1,0,2,1]
Output: false
```

**Notes:**

1. Both rectangles `rec1` and `rec2` are lists of 4 integers.
2. All coordinates in rectangles will be between `-10^9 `and` 10^9`.

## 我的方法

这道题给了两个长方形两个顶点的坐标，要判断两个长方形是否有重叠。很简单，首先判断不重叠的情况：长方形2的左下角坐标和长方形1的右上角坐标比较；或者2的右上角坐标和1的左下角坐标比较。剩下的就是重叠的情况了。

```python
class Solution:
    def isRectangleOverlap(self, rec1: List[int], rec2: List[int]) -> bool:
        x1, y1, x2, y2 = rec1
        x3, y3, x4, y4 = rec2
        if x3>=x2 or y3>=y2 or x4<=x1 or y4<=y1:
            return False
        else:
            return True
```
