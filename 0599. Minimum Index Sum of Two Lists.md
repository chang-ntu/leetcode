# 题目

Suppose Andy and Doris want to choose a restaurant for dinner, and they both have a list of favorite restaurants represented by strings.

You need to help them find out their **common interest** with the **least list index sum**. If there is a choice tie between answers, output all of them with no order requirement. You could assume there always exists an answer.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
["Shogun", "Tapioca Express", "Burger King", "KFC"]
["Piatti", "The Grill at Torrey Pines", "Hungry Hunter Steakhouse", "Shogun"]
Output: ["Shogun"]
Explanation: The only restaurant they both like is "Shogun".
```



**Example 2:**

```
Input:
["Shogun", "Tapioca Express", "Burger King", "KFC"]
["KFC", "Shogun", "Burger King"]
Output: ["Shogun"]
Explanation: The restaurant they both like and have the least index sum is "Shogun" with index sum 1 (0+1).
```



**Note:**

1. The length of both lists will be in the range of [1, 1000].
2. The length of strings in both lists will be in the range of [1, 30].
3. The index is starting from 0 to the list length minus 1.
4. No duplicates in both lists.

## 我的思路

先用字典存储一个list1的元素和index的映射，然后遍历list2，对于其中的每个元素都查找其是否在list1中。若在，比较两个index的和，若小于当前的最小值，则保存它。

```python
class Solution:
    def findRestaurant(self, list1: List[str], list2: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        l1 = len(list1)
        l2 = len(list2)
        res = []
        min_sum = l1 + l2
        dic1 = {}
        for i in range(l1):
            dic1[list1[i]] = i
        for j in range(l2):
            if list2[j] in dic1.keys():
                if dic1[list2[j]]+j < min_sum:
                    min_sum = dic1[list2[j]]+j
                    res = [list2[j]]
                elif dic1[list2[j]]+j == min_sum:
                    res.append(list2[j])
        return res
```
