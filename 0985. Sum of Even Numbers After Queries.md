# 题目

We have an array `A` of integers, and an array `queries` of queries.

For the `i`-th query `val = queries[i][0], index = queries[i][1]`, we add val to `A[index]`. Then, the answer to the `i`-th query is the sum of the even values of `A`.

*(Here, the given `index = queries[i][1]` is a 0-based index, and each query permanently modifies the array `A`.)*

Return the answer to all queries. Your `answer` array should have `answer[i]` as the answer to the `i`-th query.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: A = [1,2,3,4], queries = [[1,0],[-3,1],[-4,0],[2,3]]
Output: [8,6,2,4]
Explanation: 
At the beginning, the array is [1,2,3,4].
After adding 1 to A[0], the array is [2,2,3,4], and the sum of even values is 2 + 2 + 4 = 8.
After adding -3 to A[1], the array is [2,-1,3,4], and the sum of even values is 2 + 4 = 6.
After adding -4 to A[0], the array is [-2,-1,3,4], and the sum of even values is -2 + 4 = 2.
After adding 2 to A[3], the array is [-2,-1,3,6], and the sum of even values is -2 + 6 = 4.
```

 

**Note:**

1. `1 <= A.length <= 10000`
2. `-10000 <= A[i] <= 10000`
3. `1 <= queries.length <= 10000`
4. `-10000 <= queries[i][0] <= 10000`
5. `0 <= queries[i][1] < A.length`

## solution

题目给了一个数组A和一个数组queries，第i次查询val = queries\[i][0], index = queries\[i][1]。把val加到 A[index] 上，之后，第i次查询的答案是 A 中偶数的和。方法是直接按要求来解决，每次找出queries中的val和对应的index，然后把值加上去。

```python
class Solution:
    def sumEvenAfterQueries(self, A: List[int], queries: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        s = sum(x for x in A if x % 2 == 0)
        res = []
        for v, i in queries:
            val = A[i] + v
            if val % 2 == 0:
                s += val
            if A[i] % 2 == 0:
                s -= A[i] 
            res.append(s)
            A[i] = val
        return res
```
