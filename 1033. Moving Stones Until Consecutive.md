# 题目

Three stones are on a number line at positions `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Each turn, you pick up a stone at an endpoint (ie., either the lowest or highest position stone), and move it to an unoccupied position between those endpoints. Formally, let's say the stones are currently at positions `x, y, z` with `x < y < z`. You pick up the stone at either position `x` or position `z`, and move that stone to an integer position `k`, with `x < k < z` and `k != y`.

The game ends when you cannot make any more moves, ie. the stones are in consecutive positions.

When the game ends, what is the minimum and maximum number of moves that you could have made? Return the answer as an length 2 array: `answer = [minimum_moves, maximum_moves]`

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: a = 1, b = 2, c = 5
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: Move the stone from 5 to 3, or move the stone from 5 to 4 to 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: a = 4, b = 3, c = 2
Output: [0,0]
Explanation: We cannot make any moves.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: a = 3, b = 5, c = 1
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: Move the stone from 1 to 4; or move the stone from 1 to 2 to 4.
```

 

**Note:**

1. `1 <= a <= 100`
2. `1 <= b <= 100`
3. `1 <= c <= 100`
4. `a != b, b != c, c != a`

 ## solution

给了三块石头a,b,c及其位置，要求移到两端的任意一端的石头，直到三块石头相邻，问移动的次数最少和最多分别是多少。首先，最大值很任意看出来，最大值就是a、c中间的空位数（每次只移动一个单位，就能移动最多次数）；最小值分情况：如果a、b或b、c相邻或隔一个空位，那么只移动一次就可以使三块石头相邻。如果三块石头都隔了不止一个空位，那么最少就需要移动2次。

```python
class Solution:
    def numMovesStones(self, a: int, b: int, c: int) -> List[int]:
        x = max(a,b,c)
        z = min(a,b,c)
        y = a + b + c - x - z
        maximum_moves = x - z - 2
        if x - 1 == y and y - 1 == z:
            return [0, 0]
        if x - y == 1 or x - y == 2 or y - z == 1 or y - z == 2:
            return [1, maximum_moves]
        else:
            return [2, maximum_moves]
```
