# 题目

Given two integers `L` and `R`, find the count of numbers in the range `[L, R]` (inclusive) having a prime number of set bits in their binary representation.

(Recall that the number of set bits an integer has is the number of `1`s present when written in binary. For example, `21` written in binary is `10101` which has 3 set bits. Also, 1 is not a prime.)



**Example 1:**

```
Input: L = 6, R = 10
Output: 4
Explanation:
6 -> 110 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)
7 -> 111 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
9 -> 1001 (2 set bits , 2 is prime)
10->1010 (2 set bits , 2 is prime)
```



**Example 2:**

```
Input: L = 10, R = 15
Output: 5
Explanation:
10 -> 1010 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)
11 -> 1011 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
12 -> 1100 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)
13 -> 1101 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
14 -> 1110 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
15 -> 1111 (4 set bits, 4 is not prime)
```



**Note:**

1. `L, R` will be integers `L <= R` in the range `[1, 10^6]`.
2. `R - L` will be at most 10000.

## 我的思路

这道题要求先将`[L, R]`内的所有数字用二进制表示，然后统计一个有几个数字，用二进制表示后，其中“1”的个数为素数。于是我分两步：先统计一个数字的二进制中的“1”的个数；再判断是否为素数。

```python
class Solution:
    def countPrimeSetBits(self, L: int, R: int) -> int:
        
        def isPrime(num):
            if num == 1:
                return 0
            elif num == 2:
                return 1
            for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(num))+1):
                if num % i == 0:
                    return 0
            return 1
        
        res = 0
        for x in range(L,R+1):
            x = bin(x).count('1')
            res += isPrime(x)
            
        return res
```
