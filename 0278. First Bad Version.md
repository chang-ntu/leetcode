# 题目

You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have `n` versions `[1, 2, ..., n]` and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API `bool isBadVersion(version)` which will return whether `version` is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

**Example:**

```
Given n = 5, and version = 4 is the first bad version.

call isBadVersion(3) -> false
call isBadVersion(5) -> true
call isBadVersion(4) -> true

Then 4 is the first bad version. 
```

## 我的思路

这道题其实就是一道查找题，直接循环，遇到首个True即可，但这种方式耗时一定会较多，于是我使用二分查找法：

```python
# The isBadVersion API is already defined for you.
# @param version, an integer
# @return an integer
# def isBadVersion(version):

class Solution:
    def firstBadVersion(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        low, high = 1, n
        while low <= high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            if isBadVersion(mid):
                high = mid - 1
            else:
                low = mid + 1
        return low 
```
