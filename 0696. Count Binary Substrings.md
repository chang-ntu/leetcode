# 题目

Give a string `s`, count the number of non-empty (contiguous) substrings that have the same number of 0's and 1's, and all the 0's and all the 1's in these substrings are grouped consecutively.

Substrings that occur multiple times are counted the number of times they occur.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: "00110011"
Output: 6
Explanation: There are 6 substrings that have equal number of consecutive 1's and 0's: "0011", "01", "1100", "10", "0011", and "01".
Notice that some of these substrings repeat and are counted the number of times they occur.
Also, "00110011" is not a valid substring because all the 0's (and 1's) are not grouped together.
```



**Example 2:**

```
Input: "10101"
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 substrings: "10", "01", "10", "01" that have equal number of consecutive 1's and 0's.
```



**Note:**

`s.length` will be between 1 and 50,000.

`s` will only consist of "0" or "1" characters.

## 我的思路

这题给了一个01字符串，问有多少个子串，满足0个1的个数相等，且相同的数字不隔开。没想到什么好办法，于是看了网上的思路，非常巧妙：用一个数组来记录连续出现的0或1的个数，比如00111记录为[2,3]，11110记录为[4,1]，然后再依次寻找相邻两个元素中的最小值即可。

```python
class Solution:
    def countBinarySubstrings(self, s: str) -> int:
        l=[]
        for i in s.replace("01","0 1").replace("10","1 0").split():
            l.append(len(i))
        return sum(min(a,b) for a,b in zip(l,l[1:]))
```
