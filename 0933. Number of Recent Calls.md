# 题目

Write a class `RecentCounter` to count recent requests.

It has only one method: `ping(int t)`, where t represents some time in milliseconds.

Return the number of `ping`s that have been made from 3000 milliseconds ago until now.

Any ping with time in `[t - 3000, t]` will count, including the current ping.

It is guaranteed that every call to `ping` uses a strictly larger value of `t` than before.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: inputs = ["RecentCounter","ping","ping","ping","ping"], inputs = [[],[1],[100],[3001],[3002]]
Output: [null,1,2,3,3]
```

 

**Note:**

1. Each test case will have at most `10000` calls to `ping`.
2. Each test case will call `ping` with strictly increasing values of `t`.
3. Each call to ping will have `1 <= t <= 10^9`.

## 我的方法

这题要实现一个类，该类里面只有一个函数ping。每次输入都给了一个时间t，求在 [t-3000, t] 时间范围内有多少次 ping。方法是使用队列，每次有新的ping时令其入队；并且每次都将时间在t-3000之前的ping出队。最后返回该队列的长度即可。

```python
class RecentCounter:

    def __init__(self):
        self.q = collections.deque()
        
    def ping(self, t: int) -> int:
        self.q.append(t)
        while self.q[0] < t-3000:
            self.q.popleft()
        return len(self.q)
    
# Your RecentCounter object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = RecentCounter()
# param_1 = obj.ping(t)
```
