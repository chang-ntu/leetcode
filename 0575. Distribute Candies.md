# 题目

Given an integer array with **even** length, where different numbers in this array represent different **kinds** of candies. Each number means one candy of the corresponding kind. You need to distribute these candies **equally** in number to brother and sister. Return the maximum number of **kinds** of candies the sister could gain.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: candies = [1,1,2,2,3,3]
Output: 3
Explanation:
There are three different kinds of candies (1, 2 and 3), and two candies for each kind.
Optimal distribution: The sister has candies [1,2,3] and the brother has candies [1,2,3], too. 
The sister has three different kinds of candies. 
```



**Example 2:**

```
Input: candies = [1,1,2,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: For example, the sister has candies [2,3] and the brother has candies [1,1]. 
The sister has two different kinds of candies, the brother has only one kind of candies. 
```



**Note:**

1. The length of the given array is in range [2, 10,000], and will be even.
2. The number in given array is in range [-100,000, 100,000].

## 我的思路

这题哥哥和妹妹分糖果，每个数字代表一个种类，要求妹妹能分到的最多种类数。由于要均分，因此妹妹获得糖果的个数是一定的，因此，如果种类数比妹妹应该获得的糖果数多，那么答案就是糖果数；如果种类数没有糖果数多，那么答案就是种类数。即答案为min(种类数，妹妹应得的糖果数)。

```python
class Solution:
    def distributeCandies(self, candies: List[int]) -> int:
        kinds = len(set(candies))
        numbers = int(len(candies)/2)
        return min(numbers,kinds)
```
