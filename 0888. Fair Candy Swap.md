# 题目

Alice and Bob have candy bars of different sizes: `A[i]` is the size of the `i`-th bar of candy that Alice has, and `B[j]` is the size of the `j`-th bar of candy that Bob has.

Since they are friends, they would like to exchange one candy bar each so that after the exchange, they both have the same total amount of candy. (*The total amount of candy a person has is the sum of the sizes of candy bars they have.*)

Return an integer array `ans` where `ans[0]` is the size of the candy bar that Alice must exchange, and `ans[1]` is the size of the candy bar that Bob must exchange.

If there are multiple answers, you may return any one of them. It is guaranteed an answer exists.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: A = [1,1], B = [2,2]
Output: [1,2]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: A = [1,2], B = [2,3]
Output: [1,2]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: A = [2], B = [1,3]
Output: [2,3]
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: A = [1,2,5], B = [2,4]
Output: [5,4]
```

 

**Note:**

- `1 <= A.length <= 10000`
- `1 <= B.length <= 10000`
- `1 <= A[i] <= 100000`
- `1 <= B[i] <= 100000`
- It is guaranteed that Alice and Bob have different total amounts of candy.
- It is guaranteed there exists an answer.

## 我的方法

给了两个数组A和B，需要交换A和B的各一个数字，使得A和B的总和相等。首先，计算出A和B的和的平均值，该值就是最终A的和以及B的和。然后，根据该值，计算出A应该减去多少，为take_a，再根据该数值，在遍历A的过程中，求B中是否存在对应的数值，使得交换这两个数后，A正好减去take_a。

```python
class Solution:
    def fairCandySwap(self, A: List[int], B: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        sum_a = sum(A)
        sum_b = sum(B)
        average = (sum_a + sum_b) / 2
        take_a = sum_a - average
        for x in A:
            if (x - take_a) in B:
                return [x,x-take_a]
```
