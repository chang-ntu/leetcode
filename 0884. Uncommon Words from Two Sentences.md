# 题目

We are given two sentences `A` and `B`. (A *sentence* is a string of space separated words. Each *word* consists only of lowercase letters.)

A word is *uncommon* if it appears exactly once in one of the sentences, and does not appear in the other sentence.

Return a list of all uncommon words. 

You may return the list in any order.

 



**Example 1:**

```
Input: A = "this apple is sweet", B = "this apple is sour"
Output: ["sweet","sour"]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: A = "apple apple", B = "banana"
Output: ["banana"]
```

 

**Note:**

1. `0 <= A.length <= 200`
2. `0 <= B.length <= 200`
3. `A` and `B` both contain only spaces and lowercase letters.

## 我的方法

这题要统计在输入两个字符串中，只出现了一次的单词。方法是先将字符串转换为list，然后利用字典统计次数，输出次数为1的单词。

```python
class Solution:
    def uncommonFromSentences(self, A: str, B: str) -> List[str]:
        l = A.split(" ") + B.split(" ")
        dic = collections.Counter(l)
        res = []
        for x in dic:
            if dic[x] == 1:
                res.append(x)
        return res       
```
