# 题目

Every non-negative integer `N` has a binary representation. For example, `5` can be represented as `"101"` in binary, `11` as `"1011"` in binary, and so on. Note that except for `N = 0`, there are no leading zeroes in any binary representation.

The *complement* of a binary representation is the number in binary you get when changing every `1` to a `0` and `0` to a `1`. For example, the complement of `"101"` in binary is `"010"` in binary.

For a given number `N` in base-10, return the complement of it's binary representation as a base-10 integer.

 



**Example 1:**

```
Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: 5 is "101" in binary, with complement "010" in binary, which is 2 in base-10.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 7
Output: 0
Explanation: 7 is "111" in binary, with complement "000" in binary, which is 0 in base-10.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: 10
Output: 5
Explanation: 10 is "1010" in binary, with complement "0101" in binary, which is 5 in base-10.
```

 

**Note:**

1. `0 <= N < 10^9`
2. This question is the same as 476: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-complement/

## solution

给了一个输入N，将其转换为二进制后，逐位取反（即为补码），再以十进制输出。因为一个二进制数和它的补码的和一定是2<sup>n</sup>-1，利用这条性质，可以求解。

```python
class Solution:
    def bitwiseComplement(self, N: int) -> int:
        res=1
        if(N == 0):
            return 1
        while(res-1 < N):
            res = res*2
        return res - N - 1
```
