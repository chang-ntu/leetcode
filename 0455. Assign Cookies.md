# 题目

​	Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie. Each child i has a greed factor gi, which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size sj. If sj >= gi, we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.

**Note:**
You may assume the greed factor is always positive.
You cannot assign more than one cookie to one child.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,2,3], [1,1]

Output: 1

Explanation: You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3. 
And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.
You need to output 1.
```



**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1,2], [1,2,3]

Output: 2

Explanation: You have 2 children and 3 cookies. The greed factors of 2 children are 1, 2. 
You have 3 cookies and their sizes are big enough to gratify all of the children, 
You need to output 2.
```

## 我的思路

这道题使用贪心的策略，首先对两个数组进行排序，然后依次比较：若s[i] >= g[j]，则res+1；否则j不动，i继续向前移动，这样做的目的是每次使用s中最小的饼干来满足g中的要求。

```python
class Solution:
    def findContentChildren(self, g: List[int], s: List[int]) -> int:
        res = 0
        lg = len(g)
        ls = len(s)
        self.quick_sort(g,0,lg-1)
        self.quick_sort(s,0,ls-1)

        i, j = 0, 0
        while i < ls and j < lg:
            if s[i] >= g[j]:
                res += 1
                j += 1
            i += 1
                
        return res
    
    def quick_sort(self,array, left, right):
        if left >= right:
            return
        low = left
        high = right
        key = array[low]
        while left < right:
            while left < right and array[right] > key:
                right -= 1
            array[left] = array[right]
            while left < right and array[left] <= key:
                left += 1
            array[right] = array[left]
        array[left] = key
        self.quick_sort(array, low, left - 1)
        self.quick_sort(array, left + 1, high)
```
