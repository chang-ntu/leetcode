# 题目

Given a string and an integer k, you need to reverse the first k characters for every 2k characters counting from the start of the string. If there are less than k characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than 2k but greater than or equal to k characters, then reverse the first k characters and left the other as original.



**Example:**

```
Input: s = "abcdefg", k = 2
Output: "bacdfeg"
```



**Restrictions:**

1. The string consists of lower English letters only.
2. Length of the given string and k will in the range [1, 10000]

## 我的思路

这题很简单，用python列表的切片操作即可完成，而且不需要担心长度越界问题。

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseStr(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
        res = ""
        for i in range(0,len(s),k+k):
            res += s[i:i+k][::-1]
            res += s[i+k:i+k+k]
        return res
```
