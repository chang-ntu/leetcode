# 题目

Given an array of characters, compress it [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm).

The length after compression must always be smaller than or equal to the original array.

Every element of the array should be a **character** (not int) of length 1.

After you are done **modifying the input array [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)**, return the new length of the array.

 

**Follow up:**
Could you solve it using only O(1) extra space?

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]

Output:
Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","2","b","2","c","3"]

Explanation:
"aa" is replaced by "a2". "bb" is replaced by "b2". "ccc" is replaced by "c3".
```

 

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
["a"]

Output:
Return 1, and the first 1 characters of the input array should be: ["a"]

Explanation:
Nothing is replaced.
```

 

**Example 3:**

```
Input:
["a","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b"]

Output:
Return 4, and the first 4 characters of the input array should be: ["a","b","1","2"].

Explanation:
Since the character "a" does not repeat, it is not compressed. "bbbbbbbbbbbb" is replaced by "b12".
Notice each digit has it's own entry in the array.
```

 

**Note:**

1. All characters have an ASCII value in `[35, 126]`.
2. `1 <= len(chars) <= 1000`.

## 我的思路

我使用了两个指针i和j，其中i表示更改后的数组当前下标，j表示原数组的下标。count为某个字符重复的次数，**注意：循环结束后，最后一位并没有得到处理，因此要单独对最后一位进行处理，若count大于1就将字符及其次数写进结果中，否则将最后一位单独写进结果中。**

```python
class Solution:
    def compress(self, chars: List[str]) -> int:      
        l = len(chars)
        if l == 1:
            return 
        i = 0
        count = 1
        for j in range(1,l):
            if chars[j] == chars[j-1]:
                count += 1
            else:
                chars[i] = chars[j-1]
                i += 1
                if count > 1:
                    for x in str(count):
                        chars[i] = x
                        i += 1
                count = 1
        if count > 1:
            chars[i] = chars[j]
            i += 1
            for x in str(count):
                chars[i] = x
                i += 1
        else:
            chars[i] = chars[-1]
            i += 1
        if i < len(chars):
            k = len(chars) - i
            for m in range(k):
                del chars[-1]
```
