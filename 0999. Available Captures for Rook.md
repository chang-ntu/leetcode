# 题目

On an 8 x 8 chessboard, there is one white rook. There also may be empty squares, white bishops, and black pawns. These are given as characters 'R', '.', 'B', and 'p' respectively. Uppercase characters represent white pieces, and lowercase characters represent black pieces.

The rook moves as in the rules of Chess: it chooses one of four cardinal directions (north, east, west, and south), then moves in that direction until it chooses to stop, reaches the edge of the board, or captures an opposite colored pawn by moving to the same square it occupies. Also, rooks cannot move into the same square as other friendly bishops.

Return the number of pawns the rook can capture in one move.

Output: 3
Explanation: 
The rook can capture the pawns at positions b5, d6 and f5.
```

 

**Note:**

1. `board.length == board[i].length == 8`
2. `board[i][j]` is either `'R'`, `'.'`, `'B'`, or `'p'`
3. There is exactly one cell with `board[i][j] == 'R'`

## solution

在棋盘上已经放置了一些棋，有白棋有黑棋。问白车移动一次，有几个黑卒能够被它吃掉。首先定位白车的位置，然后对其四个方向依次查找，若遇到黑卒和res+1。

```python
class Solution:
    def numRookCaptures(self, board: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        x, y=0, 0
