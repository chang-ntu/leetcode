# 题目

We are to write the letters of a given string `S`, from left to right into lines. Each line has maximum width 100 units, and if writing a letter would cause the width of the line to exceed 100 units, it is written on the next line. We are given an array `widths`, an array where widths[0] is the width of 'a', widths[1] is the width of 'b', ..., and widths[25] is the width of 'z'.

Now answer two questions: how many lines have at least one character from `S`, and what is the width used by the last such line? Return your answer as an integer list of length 2.

 

```
Example :
Input: 
widths = [10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10]
S = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Output: [3, 60]
Explanation: 
All letters have the same length of 10. To write all 26 letters,
we need two full lines and one line with 60 units.
Example :
Input: 
widths = [4,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10]
S = "bbbcccdddaaa"
Output: [2, 4]
Explanation: 
All letters except 'a' have the same length of 10, and 
"bbbcccdddaa" will cover 9 * 10 + 2 * 4 = 98 units.
For the last 'a', it is written on the second line because
there is only 2 units left in the first line.
So the answer is 2 lines, plus 4 units in the second line.
```

 

**Note:**

- The length of `S` will be in the range [1, 1000].
- `S` will only contain lowercase letters.
- `widths` is an array of length `26`.
- `widths[i]` will be in the range of `[2, 10]`.

## 我的思路

这题很简单，记录两个值：行数和最后一行的sum。首先根据ASCII码确定下标，从widths数组中取值；然后加到当前的sum中，若超过100则另起一行。

```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfLines(self, widths: List[int], S: str) -> List[int]:
        cur_sum = 0
        line = 1
        for x in S:
            index = ord(x)-ord('a')
            if cur_sum + widths[index] > 100:
                line += 1
                cur_sum = widths[index]
            else:
                cur_sum += widths[index]
                
        return [line,cur_sum]
```
