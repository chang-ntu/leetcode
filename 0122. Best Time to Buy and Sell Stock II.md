# 题目

Say you have an array `prices` for which the *i*th element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

## 我的思路

这道题和上一道类似，只不过这道题可以无限次买入和卖出，因此其实比上一题更简单：每次只需要比较当天价格和前一天价格，只要当前价格更高，就可以把差值加入总利润中，因为可以昨天买入，今天卖出；如果明天价更高的话，就假设今天买入，明天再抛出。以此类推，遍历完整个数组后即可求得总利润。

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        if not prices:
            return 0
        res = 0
        for i in range(1,len(prices)):
            if prices[i] > prices[i-1]:
                res += prices[i] - prices[i-1]
                
        return res
```
