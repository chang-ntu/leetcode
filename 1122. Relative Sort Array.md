# 题目

Given two arrays `arr1` and `arr2`, the elements of `arr2` are distinct, and all elements in `arr2` are also in `arr1`.

Sort the elements of `arr1` such that the relative ordering of items in `arr1` are the same as in `arr2`. Elements that don't appear in `arr2` should be placed at the end of `arr1` in **ascending** order.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: arr1 = [2,3,1,3,2,4,6,7,9,2,19], arr2 = [2,1,4,3,9,6]
Output: [2,2,2,1,4,3,3,9,6,7,19]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `arr1.length, arr2.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= arr1[i], arr2[i] <= 1000`
- Each `arr2[i]` is distinct.
- Each `arr2[i]` is in `arr1`.

## solution

给了两个数组arr1和arr2，arr2中的元素都在arr1中。现在要求在arr1中将既在arr1又在arr2中的元素按arr2中的相对位置排列，其他元素按升序排在最后。用字典dic来记录arr1中元素及其次数，用not_in_arr2来记录在arr1中但不在arr2中的元素。

```python
class Solution:
    def relativeSortArray(self, arr1: List[int], arr2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        res = []
        dic = {}
        not_in_arr2 = []
        for x in arr1:
            if x not in dic.keys():
                dic[x] = 1
            else:
                dic[x] += 1
        for x in arr2:
            l = dic[x]
            for _ in range(l):
                res.append(x)
                dic[x] -= 1
        for x in dic:
            if dic[x] != 0:
                l = dic[x]
                for _ in range(l):
                    not_in_arr2.append(x)
        not_in_arr2.sort()
        res.extend(not_in_arr2)
        return res
```
