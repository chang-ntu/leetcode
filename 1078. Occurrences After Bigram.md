# 题目

Given words `first` and `second`, consider occurrences in some `text` of the form "`first second third`", where `second` comes immediately after `first`, and `third` comes immediately after `second`.

For each such occurrence, add "`third`" to the answer, and return the answer.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: text = "alice is a good girl she is a good student", first = "a", second = "good"
Output: ["girl","student"]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: text = "we will we will rock you", first = "we", second = "will"
Output: ["we","rock"]
```

 

**Note:**

1. `1 <= text.length <= 1000`
2. `text` consists of space separated words, where each word consists of lowercase English letters.
3. `1 <= first.length, second.length <= 10`
4. `first` and `second` consist of lowercase English letters.

## solution

先将原字符串转换成数组，然后遍历该数组，若遇到第i个和第i+1个分别是first和second，那么就将i+3保存到结果中。

```python
class Solution:
    def findOcurrences(self, text: str, first: str, second: str) -> List[str]:
        ltext = text.split(" ")
        res = []
        for i in range(len(ltext)-2):
            if ltext[i] == first:
                if ltext[i+1] == second:
                    res.append(ltext[i+2])
        return res
```
