# 题目

In a string `S` of lowercase letters, these letters form consecutive groups of the same character.

For example, a string like `S = "abbxxxxzyy"` has the groups `"a"`, `"bb"`, `"xxxx"`, `"z"` and `"yy"`.

Call a group *large* if it has 3 or more characters. We would like the starting and ending positions of every large group.

The final answer should be in lexicographic order.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: "abbxxxxzzy"
Output: [[3,6]]
Explanation: "xxxx" is the single large group with starting  3 and ending positions 6.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: "abc"
Output: []
Explanation: We have "a","b" and "c" but no large group.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: "abcdddeeeeaabbbcd"
Output: [[3,5],[6,9],[12,14]]
```

 

**Note:** `1 <= S.length <= 1000`

## 我的思路

这题用指针来完成，一个指针i遍历原字符串，一个数字j记录出现的连续相同字符的个数。若j>3，则记录下标。

```python
class Solution:
    def largeGroupPositions(self, S: str) -> List[List[int]]:
        res = []
        i = 0
        j = 1
        while i < len(S)-1:
            if S[i] == S[i+1]:
                j += 1
            else:
                if j >= 3:
                    res.append([i-j+1,i])
                j = 1
            i += 1
        if j >= 3:
            res.append([i-j+1,i])
        return res
```
