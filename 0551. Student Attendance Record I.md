# 题目

You are given a string representing an attendance record for a student. The record only contains the following three characters:



1. **'A'** : Absent.
2. **'L'** : Late.
3. **'P'** : Present.



A student could be rewarded if his attendance record doesn't contain **more than one 'A' (absent)** or **more than two continuous 'L' (late)**.

You need to return whether the student could be rewarded according to his attendance record.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: "PPALLP"
Output: True
```



**Example 2:**

```
Input: "PPALLL"
Output: False
```

## 我的思路

这题很简单，直接用python string的count函数即可。

```python
class Solution:
    def checkRecord(self, s: str) -> bool:
        if  s.count('A')>1 or s.count('LLL')>0:
            return False
        return True
```
