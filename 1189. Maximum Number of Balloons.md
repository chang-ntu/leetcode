# 题目

Given a string `text`, you want to use the characters of `text` to form as many instances of the word **"balloon"** as possible.

You can use each character in `text` **at most once**. Return the maximum number of instances that can be formed.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: text = "loonbalxballpoon"
Output: 2
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: text = "leetcode"
Output: 0
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= text.length <= 10^4`
- `text` consists of lower case English letters only.

## solution

求给的字符串中，能组成多少个“balloon”。先统计每个字符的个数，然后判断。

```python
class Solution:
    def maxNumberOfBalloons(self, text: str) -> int:
        dic = {}
        for x in text:
            if x in dic.keys():
                dic[x] += 1
            else:
                dic[x] = 1
        for x in "balloon":
            if x not in dic.keys():
                return 0
        dic['l'] //= 2
        dic['o'] //= 2
        return min(dic[x] for x in "balloon")
```
