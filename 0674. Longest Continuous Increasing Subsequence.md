# 题目

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest `continuous` increasing subsequence (subarray).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,3,5,4,7]
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [1,3,5], its length is 3. 
Even though [1,3,5,7] is also an increasing subsequence, it's not a continuous one where 5 and 7 are separated by 4. 
```



**Example 2:**

```
Input: [2,2,2,2,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [2], its length is 1. 
```



**Note:** Length of the array will not exceed 10,000.

## 我的思路

要寻找最长的连续子串，要求该子串是升序的。我的方法是遍历数组，然后计数，并动态保存最大值。

```python
class Solution:
    def findLengthOfLCIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if not nums:
            return 0
        res = 1
        count = 1
        for i in range(len(nums)-1):
            if nums[i] < nums[i+1]:
                count += 1
                if count > res:
                    res = count
            else:
                count = 1
        return res
```
