# 题目

Winter is coming! Your first job during the contest is to design a standard heater with fixed warm radius to warm all the houses.

Now, you are given positions of houses and heaters on a horizontal line, find out minimum radius of heaters so that all houses could be covered by those heaters.

So, your input will be the positions of houses and heaters seperately, and your expected output will be the minimum radius standard of heaters.

**Note:**

1. Numbers of houses and heaters you are given are non-negative and will not exceed 25000.
2. Positions of houses and heaters you are given are non-negative and will not exceed 10^9.
3. As long as a house is in the heaters' warm radius range, it can be warmed.
4. All the heaters follow your radius standard and the warm radius will the same.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,2,3],[2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The only heater was placed in the position 2, and if we use the radius 1 standard, then all the houses can be warmed.
```

 

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1,2,3,4],[1,4]
Output: 1
Explanation: The two heater was placed in the position 1 and 4. We need to use radius 1 standard, then all the houses can be warmed.
```

## 我的思路

这道题用一个动态的思想来做，首先将houses数组和heaters数组排序，将heaters数组头尾两端分别加一个负无穷和正无穷。然后遍历houses，对于house中的每一个元素x，找出它在heaters数组中的位置，这样就能确定离x最近的heater（要么是它左边的heater，要么是它右边的heater），令距离为dis，遍历完houses后，最大的dis即为所求。

```python
class Solution:
    def findRadius(self, houses: List[int], heaters: List[int]) -> int:
        houses.sort()
        heaters.sort()
        heaters = [float('-inf')]+heaters+[float('inf')]
        r = i = 0 
        for x in houses:
            while x > heaters[i+1]:
                i += 1
            dis = min (x - heaters[i], heaters[i+1]- x)
            r = max(r, dis)
        return r
```
