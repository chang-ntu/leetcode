# 题目

Given a positive integer `N`, find and return the longest distance between two consecutive 1's in the binary representation of `N`.

If there aren't two consecutive 1's, return 0.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 22
Output: 2
Explanation: 
22 in binary is 0b10110.
In the binary representation of 22, there are three ones, and two consecutive pairs of 1's.
The first consecutive pair of 1's have distance 2.
The second consecutive pair of 1's have distance 1.
The answer is the largest of these two distances, which is 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: 
5 in binary is 0b101.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: 6
Output: 1
Explanation: 
6 in binary is 0b110.
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: 8
Output: 0
Explanation: 
8 in binary is 0b1000.
There aren't any consecutive pairs of 1's in the binary representation of 8, so we return 0.
```



**Note:**

- `1 <= N <= 10^9`

## 我的方法

这题要找出N用二进制表示后，两个“1”的最远距离。首先将N转换为二进制，然后遍历N中的每一位数字。存储前一个“1”的位置，每次计算和前一个“1”的距离，并存储最大的值。

```python
class Solution:
    def binaryGap(self, N: int) -> int:
        res = float('-inf')
        b = bin(N)[2:]
        pre = -1
        for i in range(len(b)):
            if b[i] == "1":
                if pre == -1:
                    pre = i
                res = max(res,i-pre)
                pre = i
        return res                
```
