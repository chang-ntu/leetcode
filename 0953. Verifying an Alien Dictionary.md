# 题目

In an alien language, surprisingly they also use english lowercase letters, but possibly in a different `order`. The `order` of the alphabet is some permutation of lowercase letters.

Given a sequence of `words` written in the alien language, and the `order` of the alphabet, return `true` if and only if the given `words` are sorted lexicographicaly in this alien language.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: words = ["hello","leetcode"], order = "hlabcdefgijkmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Output: true
Explanation: As 'h' comes before 'l' in this language, then the sequence is sorted.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: words = ["word","world","row"], order = "worldabcefghijkmnpqstuvxyz"
Output: false
Explanation: As 'd' comes after 'l' in this language, then words[0] > words[1], hence the sequence is unsorted.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: words = ["apple","app"], order = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Output: false
Explanation: The first three characters "app" match, and the second string is shorter (in size.) According to lexicographical rules "apple" > "app", because 'l' > '∅', where '∅' is defined as the blank character which is less than any other character (More info).
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= words.length <= 100`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 20`
- `order.length == 26`
- All characters in `words[i]` and `order` are English lowercase letters.

## 我的方法

这题要判断给的words中单词的排列顺序是否满足外星人的字典顺序。首先创建字典，储存外星人字典的顺序。然后将words中的单词两两比较。

```python
class Solution:
    def isAlienSorted(self, words: List[str], order: str) -> bool:
        dic = {}
        for i in range(len(order)):
            dic[order[i]] = i
        l = len(words)
        for i in range(l-1):
            x1 = words[i]
            x2 = words[i+1]
            l2 = min(len(x1),len(x2))
            for j in range(l2):
                if dic[x1[j]] < dic[x2[j]]:
                    break
                elif j == l2-1 and len(x2) < len(x1):
                    return False
                elif dic[x1[j]] > dic[x2[j]]:
                    return False
        return True
```
