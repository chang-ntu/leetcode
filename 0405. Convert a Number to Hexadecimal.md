# 题目

Given an integer, write an algorithm to convert it to hexadecimal. For negative integer, [two’s complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two's_complement) method is used.

**Note:**

1. All letters in hexadecimal (`a-f`) must be in lowercase.
2. The hexadecimal string must not contain extra leading `0`s. If the number is zero, it is represented by a single zero character `'0'`; otherwise, the first character in the hexadecimal string will not be the zero character.
3. The given number is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
4. You **must not use \*any\* method provided by the library** which converts/formats the number to hex directly.



**Example 1:**

```
Input:
26

Output:
"1a"
```



**Example 2:**

```
Input:
-1

Output:
"ffffffff"
```

## 我的思路

首先，建立字典。将num&15，可以得到num最右边4位的bit，然后将其在字典中对应的16进制数字取出。每次将num右移4位，因为最多是32位，所以最多进行8次操作即可。最后，将前面多余的0去掉。

```python
class Solution:
    def toHex(self, num: int) -> str:
        if num == 0:
            return "0"
        res = ""
        dic = ["0","1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9","a","b","c","d","e","f"]
        for i in range(8):
            res = dic[num & 0xf] + res
            num = num >> 4
            
        return res.lstrip("0")
```
