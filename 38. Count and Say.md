# 题目

The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:

```
1.     1
2.     11
3.     21
4.     1211
5.     111221
```

`1` is read off as `"one 1"` or `11`.
`11` is read off as `"two 1s"` or `21`.
`21` is read off as `"one 2`, then `one 1"` or `1211`.

Given an integer *n* where 1 ≤ *n* ≤ 30, generate the *n*th term of the count-and-say sequence. You can do so recursively, in other words from the previous member read off the digits, counting the number of digits in groups of the same digit.

Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 1
Output: "1"
Explanation: This is the base case.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 4
Output: "1211"
Explanation: For n = 3 the term was "21" in which we have two groups "2" and "1", "2" can be read as "12" which means frequency = 1 and value = 2, the same way "1" is read as "11", so the answer is the concatenation of "12" and "11" which is "1211".
```

## 我的思路

这道题看着复杂，其实不难。只要根据题目给的“读数字”的规则，对于前一个数，找出相同元素的个数并存到新的string中即可。需要注意的是：由于需要对每一个字符判断它是否与后面一个相同，因此遍历字符串的时候不能遍历到最后一个字符串，最后一个字符串需要单独拿出来处理。

```python
class Solution:
    def countAndSay(self, n: int) -> str:
        if n == 1:
            return "1"
        res = "1"
        for i in range(n-1):
            temp = ""
            t = 1
            for j in range(len(res)-1):
                if res[j] == res[j+1]:
                    t += 1
                    continue
                temp = temp + str(t) + res[j]
                t = 1
            temp = temp + str(t) + res[-1]       
            res = temp
        return res
```
