# 题目

We have two special characters. The first character can be represented by one bit `0`. The second character can be represented by two bits (`10` or `11`).

Now given a string represented by several bits. Return whether the last character must be a one-bit character or not. The given string will always end with a zero.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 
bits = [1, 0, 0]
Output: True
Explanation: 
The only way to decode it is two-bit character and one-bit character. So the last character is one-bit character.
```



**Example 2:**

```
Input: 
bits = [1, 1, 1, 0]
Output: False
Explanation: 
The only way to decode it is two-bit character and two-bit character. So the last character is NOT one-bit character.
```



**Note:**

`1 <= len(bits) <= 1000`.

`bits[i]` is always `0` or `1`.

## 我的思路

有两类用二进制表示的数，第一类是0，第二类是10或11，要判断给定的数组拆分为这两类数后，最后一个数是否一定为0。方法是用循环，如果遇到1则直接向后跳两位，因为1后面不管是0还是1（10或11），都不是第一类数字结尾。如果遇到0，则向后移动一位，直到整个数组结尾。

```python
class Solution:
    def isOneBitCharacter(self, bits: List[int]) -> bool:
        l = len(bits)
        if l == 1:
            return True
        i = 0
        while i < l:
            if bits[i] == 1:
                i += 2
                if i == l:
                    return False
            else:
                i += 1
        return True
```
