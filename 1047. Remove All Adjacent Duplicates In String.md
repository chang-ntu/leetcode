# 题目

Given a string `S` of lowercase letters, a *duplicate removal* consists of choosing two adjacent and equal letters, and removing them.

We repeatedly make duplicate removals on S until we no longer can.

Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made. It is guaranteed the answer is unique.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: "abbaca"
Output: "ca"
Explanation: 
For example, in "abbaca" we could remove "bb" since the letters are adjacent and equal, and this is the only possible move.  The result of this move is that the string is "aaca", of which only "aa" is possible, so the final string is "ca".
```

 

**Note:**

1. `1 <= S.length <= 20000`
2. `S` consists only of English lowercase letters.

## solution

给了一个字符串，重复做一个操作：如果有两个相邻的字符相同，那么就把它们都删去。直到最后没有字符可以删，返回结果。用栈的思想来做，如果即将入栈的元素和栈顶元素相同，那么不入栈，并且将栈顶元素pop。

```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, S: str) -> str:
        res = []
        res.append(S[0])
        for i in range(1,len(S)):
            if res and S[i] == res[-1]:
                res.pop()
            else:
                res.append(S[i])
        return "".join(res)
```
