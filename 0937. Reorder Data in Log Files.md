# 题目

You have an array of `logs`. Each log is a space delimited string of words.

For each log, the first word in each log is an alphanumeric *identifier*. Then, either:

- Each word after the identifier will consist only of lowercase letters, or;
- Each word after the identifier will consist only of digits.

We will call these two varieties of logs *letter-logs* and *digit-logs*. It is guaranteed that each log has at least one word after its identifier.

Reorder the logs so that all of the letter-logs come before any digit-log. The letter-logs are ordered lexicographically ignoring identifier, with the identifier used in case of ties. The digit-logs should be put in their original order.

Return the final order of the logs.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: logs = ["dig1 8 1 5 1","let1 art can","dig2 3 6","let2 own kit dig","let3 art zero"]
Output: ["let1 art can","let3 art zero","let2 own kit dig","dig1 8 1 5 1","dig2 3 6"]
```

 

**Constraints:**

1. `0 <= logs.length <= 100`
2. `3 <= logs[i].length <= 100`
3. `logs[i]` is guaranteed to have an identifier, and a word after the identifier.

## 我的方法

这题要对输入的字符串数组进行重新排列，按照要求重排即可。

```python
class Solution:
    def reorderLogFiles(self, logs: 'List[str]') -> 'List[str]':
        l, d = [], []
        for log in logs:
            second = log.split()[1]
            if second.isdigit():
                d.append(log)
            else:
                l.append(log)
        # reorder the letter logs        
        l.sort(key = lambda x: x.split()[0])
        l.sort(key = lambda x: x.split()[1:])
        return l+d
```
