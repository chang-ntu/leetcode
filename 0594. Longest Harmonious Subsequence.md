# 题目

We define a harmounious array as an array where the difference between its maximum value and its minimum value is **exactly** 1.

Now, given an integer array, you need to find the length of its longest harmonious subsequence among all its possible [subsequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsequence).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,3,2,2,5,2,3,7]
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest harmonious subsequence is [3,2,2,2,3].
```

## 我的思路

首先建立字典，储存每个元素的个数。这道题只要找到个数最多的两个数字（只能相差1）即可，因此遍历字典，找出两个数字的个数的最大值。

```python
class Solution:
    def findLHS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        res = 0
        dic = collections.Counter(nums)
        for x in dic:
            if x+1 in dic:
                res = max(res,dic[x]+dic[x+1])
        return res
```
