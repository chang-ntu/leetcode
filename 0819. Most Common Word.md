# 题目

Given a paragraph and a list of banned words, return the most frequent word that is not in the list of banned words. It is guaranteed there is at least one word that isn't banned, and that the answer is unique.

Words in the list of banned words are given in lowercase, and free of punctuation. Words in the paragraph are not case sensitive. The answer is in lowercase.

 

**Example:**

```
Input: 
paragraph = "Bob hit a ball, the hit BALL flew far after it was hit."
banned = ["hit"]
Output: "ball"
Explanation: 
"hit" occurs 3 times, but it is a banned word.
"ball" occurs twice (and no other word does), so it is the most frequent non-banned word in the paragraph. 
Note that words in the paragraph are not case sensitive,
that punctuation is ignored (even if adjacent to words, such as "ball,"), 
and that "hit" isn't the answer even though it occurs more because it is banned.
```

 

**Note:**

- `1 <= paragraph.length <= 1000`.
- `0 <= banned.length <= 100`.
- `1 <= banned[i].length <= 10`.
- The answer is unique, and written in lowercase (even if its occurrences in `paragraph` may have uppercase symbols, and even if it is a proper noun.)
- `paragraph` only consists of letters, spaces, or the punctuation symbols `!?',;.`
- There are no hyphens or hyphenated words.
- Words only consist of letters, never apostrophes or other punctuation symbols.

## 我的思路

题目给出了一段文字，并给出了一个过滤词的列表。过滤完之后，在剩下的单词里，找出出现次数最多的词。同时，忽略所有标点。首先，将字符串转换为小写，将所有标点符号都转化为空格，然后将paragraph再转化为列表，统计列表中不在banned的单词的频率，最后找出频率最高的单词。

```python
class Solution:
    def mostCommonWord(self, paragraph: str, banned: List[str]) -> str:
        s = ''
        for ch in paragraph.lower():
            if ch in "!?',;.":
                s += ' '
            else:
                s += ch         
        count = collections.Counter([word for word in s.split() if word not in banned])
        _max = max(count.values())
        for word in count:
            if count[word] == _max:
                return word 
```
