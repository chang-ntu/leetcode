# 题目

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
             Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [2,7,9,3,1]
Output: 12
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
             Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.
```

## 我的思路

这道题是一道典型的动态规划题，res[i]记录到第i个房子时能够抢到的最大金额。首先初始化res[0]和res[1]，然后res[i] = max(res[i-2]+nums[i],res[i-1])。

```python
class Solution:
    def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if not nums:
            return 0
        if len(nums) == 1:
            return nums[0]
        res = []
        res.append(nums[0])
        res.append(max(nums[0],nums[1]))
        for i in range(2,len(nums)):
            res.append(max(res[i-2]+nums[i],res[i-1]))
            
        return res[-1]
```
