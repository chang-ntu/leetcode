# 题目

Suppose we have a class:

```
public class Foo {
  public void first() { print("first"); }
  public void second() { print("second"); }
  public void third() { print("third"); }
}
```

The same instance of `Foo` will be passed to three different threads. Thread A will call `first()`, thread B will call `second()`, and thread C will call `third()`. Design a mechanism and modify the program to ensure that `second()` is executed after `first()`, and `third()` is executed after `second()`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,2,3]
Output: "firstsecondthird"
Explanation: There are three threads being fired asynchronously. The input [1,2,3] means thread A calls first(), thread B calls second(), and thread C calls third(). "firstsecondthird" is the correct output.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1,3,2]
Output: "firstsecondthird"
Explanation: The input [1,3,2] means thread A calls first(), thread B calls third(), and thread C calls second(). "firstsecondthird" is the correct output.
```

 

**Note:**

We do not know how the threads will be scheduled in the operating system, even though the numbers in the input seems to imply the ordering. The input format you see is mainly to ensure our tests' comprehensiveness.

## solution

这道题要求将三个线程按给定顺序执行。关于python中的线程操作之前并没有接触过，查了网上的python线程操作方法后，完成了此题。

```python
from threading import Lock
class Foo:
    def __init__(self):
        pass
        self.lock1 = Lock()
        self.lock2 = Lock()
        self.lock1.acquire()
        self.lock2.acquire()


    def first(self, printFirst: 'Callable[[], None]') -> None:
        
        # printFirst() outputs "first". Do not change or remove this line.
        printFirst()
        self.lock1.release()


    def second(self, printSecond: 'Callable[[], None]') -> None:
        
        # printSecond() outputs "second". Do not change or remove this line.
        with self.lock1:
            printSecond()
            self.lock2.release()


    def third(self, printThird: 'Callable[[], None]') -> None:
        
        # printThird() outputs "third". Do not change or remove this line.
        with self.lock2:
            printThird()
```
