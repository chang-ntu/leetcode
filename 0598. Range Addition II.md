# 题目

Given an m * n matrix **M** initialized with all **0**'s and several update operations.

Operations are represented by a 2D array, and each operation is represented by an array with two **positive** integers **a** and **b**, which means **M[i][j]** should be **added by one** for all **0 <= i < a** and **0 <= j < b**.

You need to count and return the number of maximum integers in the matrix after performing all the operations.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 
m = 3, n = 3
operations = [[2,2],[3,3]]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
Initially, M = 
[[0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0]]

After performing [2,2], M = 
[[1, 1, 0],
 [1, 1, 0],
 [0, 0, 0]]

After performing [3,3], M = 
[[2, 2, 1],
 [2, 2, 1],
 [1, 1, 1]]

So the maximum integer in M is 2, and there are four of it in M. So return 4.
```



**Note:**

1. The range of m and n is [1,40000].
2. The range of a is [1,m], and the range of b is [1,n].
3. The range of operations size won't exceed 10,000.

## 我的思路

这题要做的是每次对 下标[a,b]在0 <= i < a, 0 <= j < b范围内的数进行+1操作。由于下标一定是从0开始，因此矩阵左上角的数字每次都会被进行+1操作，因此最大的数字也一定集中在左上角。要求最大的数字有多少个，那么就看所有a中的最小值，和所有b中的最小值，a*b就是个数。

```python
class Solution:
    def maxCount(self, m: int, n: int, ops: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if not ops:
            return m*n
        a = min(op[0] for op in ops)
        b = min(op[1] for op in ops)
        return a*b              
```
