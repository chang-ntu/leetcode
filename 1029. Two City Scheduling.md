# 题目

A company is planning to interview `2n` people. Given the array `costs` where `costs[i] = [aCosti, bCosti]`, the cost of flying the `ith` person to city `a` is `aCosti`, and the cost of flying the `ith` person to city `b` is `bCosti`.

Return *the minimum cost to fly every person to a city* such that exactly `n` people arrive in each city.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: costs = [[10,20],[30,200],[400,50],[30,20]]
Output: 110
Explanation: 
The first person goes to city A for a cost of 10.
The second person goes to city A for a cost of 30.
The third person goes to city B for a cost of 50.
The fourth person goes to city B for a cost of 20.

The total minimum cost is 10 + 30 + 50 + 20 = 110 to have half the people interviewing in each city.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: costs = [[259,770],[448,54],[926,667],[184,139],[840,118],[577,469]]
Output: 1859
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: costs = [[515,563],[451,713],[537,709],[343,819],[855,779],[457,60],[650,359],[631,42]]
Output: 3086
```

**Constraints:**

- `2n == costs.length`
- `2 <= costs.length <= 100`
- `costs.length` is even.
- `1 <= aCosti, bCosti <= 1000`

## solution

一共有2n个人，给出了每个人去a城市和b城市的代价，要求出将这个2n个人平均分到a城和b城的最小代价。利用贪心算法，将去a城最省钱的n个人去a城，剩下的n个人去b城。因此，只要计算每个人去a城和b城的代价差值b-a，差值越大说明去a城越省钱，因此将该值排序后，前n个人去a城，后n个人去b城。

```python
class Solution:
    def twoCitySchedCost(self, costs: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        res = 0
        c = []
        for x in costs:
            c.append([x,x[1]-x[0]])
        c = sorted(c, key=(lambda x : x[1]))
        n = len(costs)
        for i in range(n):
            if i < n/2:
                res += c[i][0][1] 
            else:
                res +=c[i][0][0]
        return res
```
