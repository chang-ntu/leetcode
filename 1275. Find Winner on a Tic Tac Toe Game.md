# 题目

Tic-tac-toe is played by two players *A* and *B* on a *3* x *3* grid.

Here are the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe:

- Players take turns placing characters into empty squares (" ").
- The first player *A* always places "X" characters, while the second player *B* always places "O" characters.
- "X" and "O" characters are always placed into empty squares, never on filled ones.
- The game ends when there are 3 of the same (non-empty) character filling any row, column, or diagonal.
- The game also ends if all squares are non-empty.
- No more moves can be played if the game is over.

Given an array `moves` where each element is another array of size 2 corresponding to the row and column of the grid where they mark their respective character in the order in which *A* and *B* play.

Return the winner of the game if it exists (*A* or *B*), in case the game ends in a draw return "Draw", if there are still movements to play return "Pending".

You can assume that `moves` is **valid** (It follows the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe), the grid is initially empty and *A* will play **first**.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: moves = [[0,0],[2,0],[1,1],[2,1],[2,2]]
Output: "A"
Explanation: "A" wins, he always plays first.
"X  "    "X  "    "X  "    "X  "    "X  "
"   " -> "   " -> " X " -> " X " -> " X "
"   "    "O  "    "O  "    "OO "    "OOX"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: moves = [[0,0],[1,1],[0,1],[0,2],[1,0],[2,0]]
Output: "B"
Explanation: "B" wins.
"X  "    "X  "    "XX "    "XXO"    "XXO"    "XXO"
"   " -> " O " -> " O " -> " O " -> "XO " -> "XO " 
"   "    "   "    "   "    "   "    "   "    "O  "
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: moves = [[0,0],[1,1],[2,0],[1,0],[1,2],[2,1],[0,1],[0,2],[2,2]]
Output: "Draw"
Explanation: The game ends in a draw since there are no moves to make.
"XXO"
"OOX"
"XOX"
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: moves = [[0,0],[1,1]]
Output: "Pending"
Explanation: The game has not finished yet.
"X  "
" O "
"   "
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= moves.length <= 9`
- `moves[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= moves[i][j] <= 2`
- There are no repeated elements on `moves`.
- `moves` follow the rules of tic tac toe.

## solution

这道题要求找出“三子棋”的获胜者，输入一组数组，其中每个元素代表当前玩家放置棋子的位置。当最后一个玩家下完时，游戏有四种结果：A胜，B胜，Pending，或者Draw。因此，针对最后一个落子者，判断他是否胜利。若不胜利，且棋盘已被下满，则输出Draw；否则Pending。

```python
class Solution:
    def tictactoe(self, moves: List[List[int]]) -> str:
        m = len(moves);
        count = [0] * 8;
        for i in range(m-1,-1,-2):
            print(i)
            count[moves[i][0]] += 1
            count[moves[i][1] + 3] += 1
            if moves[i][0] == moves[i][1]:
                count[6] += 1    
            if (moves[i][0] + moves[i][1]) == 2 :
                count[7] += 1
            if count[moves[i][0]] == 3 or count[moves[i][1] + 3] == 3 or          count[6] == 3 or count[7] == 3 :
                return "B" if m % 2 == 0 else "A"
        if len(moves) < 9:
            return "Pending"
        return "Draw"
```
