# 题目

Your friend is typing his `name` into a keyboard. Sometimes, when typing a character `c`, the key might get *long pressed*, and the character will be typed 1 or more times.

You examine the `typed` characters of the keyboard. Return `True` if it is possible that it was your friends name, with some characters (possibly none) being long pressed.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: name = "alex", typed = "aaleex"
Output: true
Explanation: 'a' and 'e' in 'alex' were long pressed.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: name = "saeed", typed = "ssaaedd"
Output: false
Explanation: 'e' must have been pressed twice, but it wasn't in the typed output.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: name = "leelee", typed = "lleeelee"
Output: true
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: name = "laiden", typed = "laiden"
Output: true
Explanation: It's not necessary to long press any character.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= name.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= typed.length <= 1000`
- The characters of `name` and `typed` are lowercase letters.

## 我的方法

用两个指针，分别在两个字符串上移动。若指的字符相同则继续移动；若不同，将typed中的字符和name中的对应位置的前一个进行对比，若相同则说明是重复字符。值得注意的是，遍历完后需要对两个指针分别进行判断。

```python
class Solution:
    def isLongPressedName(self, name: str, typed: str) -> bool:
        ln = len(name)
        lt = len(typed)
        i, j = 0, 0
        while i < ln and j < lt:
            if name[i] == typed[j]:
                i += 1
                j += 1
            elif j > 0 and typed[j-1] == typed[j]:
                j += 1
            else:
                return False
        if i != ln:
            return False
        elif j != lt:
            while j < lt:
                if typed[j-1] == typed[j]:
                    j += 1
                else:
                    return False
            return True
        else:
            return True
```
