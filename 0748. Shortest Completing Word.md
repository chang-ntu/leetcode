# 题目

Find the minimum length word from a given dictionary `words`, which has all the letters from the string `licensePlate`. Such a word is said to *complete* the given string `licensePlate`

Here, for letters we ignore case. For example, `"P"` on the `licensePlate` still matches `"p"` on the word.

It is guaranteed an answer exists. If there are multiple answers, return the one that occurs first in the array.

The license plate might have the same letter occurring multiple times. For example, given a `licensePlate` of `"PP"`, the word `"pair"` does not complete the `licensePlate`, but the word `"supper"` does.



**Example 1:**

```
Input: licensePlate = "1s3 PSt", words = ["step", "steps", "stripe", "stepple"]
Output: "steps"
Explanation: The smallest length word that contains the letters "S", "P", "S", and "T".
Note that the answer is not "step", because the letter "s" must occur in the word twice.
Also note that we ignored case for the purposes of comparing whether a letter exists in the word.
```



**Example 2:**

```
Input: licensePlate = "1s3 456", words = ["looks", "pest", "stew", "show"]
Output: "pest"
Explanation: There are 3 smallest length words that contains the letters "s".
We return the one that occurred first.
```



**Note:**

1. `licensePlate` will be a string with length in range `[1, 7]`.
2. `licensePlate` will contain digits, spaces, or letters (uppercase or lowercase).
3. `words` will have a length in the range `[10, 1000]`.
4. Every `words[i]` will consist of lowercase letters, and have length in range `[1, 15]`.

## 我的思路

这题乍一看很长，其实很简单，首先把给定的licensePlate字符串转化为小写并且去掉数字和空格，然后判断words中的元素，如果都包含licensePlate的元素，那么将其append到res数组中，最后输出一个长度最短的。

```python
class Solution:
    def shortestCompletingWord(self, licensePlate: str, words: List[str]) -> str:
        res = []
        a=''.join(l for l in licensePlate.lower() if l.isalpha())
        for x in words:
            if all(collections.Counter(x)[k] >= collections.Counter(a)[k] for k in collections.Counter(a)):
                res.append(x)
                
        index = 0
        min_len = len(res[index])
        for i in range(len(res)):
            if len(res[i]) < min_len:
                min_len = len(res[i])
                index = i
        return res[index]
```
