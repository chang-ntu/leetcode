# 题目

A sentence `S` is given, composed of words separated by spaces. Each word consists of lowercase and uppercase letters only.

We would like to convert the sentence to "*Goat Latin"* (a made-up language similar to Pig Latin.)

The rules of Goat Latin are as follows:

- If a word begins with a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u), append `"ma"` to the end of the word.
  For example, the word 'apple' becomes 'applema'.
   
- If a word begins with a consonant (i.e. not a vowel), remove the first letter and append it to the end, then add `"ma"`.
  For example, the word `"goat"` becomes `"oatgma"`.
   
- Add one letter `'a'` to the end of each word per its word index in the sentence, starting with 1.
  For example, the first word gets `"a"` added to the end, the second word gets `"aa"` added to the end and so on.

Return the final sentence representing the conversion from `S` to Goat Latin. 

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: "I speak Goat Latin"
Output: "Imaa peaksmaaa oatGmaaaa atinLmaaaaa"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog"
Output: "heTmaa uickqmaaa rownbmaaaa oxfmaaaaa umpedjmaaaaaa overmaaaaaaa hetmaaaaaaaa azylmaaaaaaaaa ogdmaaaaaaaaaa"
```

 

Notes:

- `S` contains only uppercase, lowercase and spaces. Exactly one space between each word.
- `1 <= S.length <= 150`.

## 我的思路

这题是字符串操作题，把英文句子按照空格分割成各个单词。如果单词以元音字母开头，后面接上`"ma"`；如果不以元音开头，把首字母移到最后，然后接上`"ma"`；每个单词后面接上在句子中出现的第几位置个`"a"`。

```python
class Solution:
    def toGoatLatin(self, S: str) -> str:
        vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U']
        words = S.split(' ')
        res = []
        for i in range(len(words)):
            if words[i][0] in vowels:
                words[i] += 'ma'
            else:
                words[i] = words[i][1:] + words[i][0] + 'ma'
            words[i] += 'a' * (i + 1)
            res.append(words[i])
        return ' '.join(res)
```
