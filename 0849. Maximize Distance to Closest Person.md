# 题目

In a row of `seats`, `1` represents a person sitting in that seat, and `0` represents that the seat is empty. 

There is at least one empty seat, and at least one person sitting.

Alex wants to sit in the seat such that the distance between him and the closest person to him is maximized. 

Return that maximum distance to closest person.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,0,0,0,1,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
If Alex sits in the second open seat (seats[2]), then the closest person has distance 2.
If Alex sits in any other open seat, the closest person has distance 1.
Thus, the maximum distance to the closest person is 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1,0,0,0]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
If Alex sits in the last seat, the closest person is 3 seats away.
This is the maximum distance possible, so the answer is 3.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= seats.length <= 20000`
- `seats` contains only 0s or 1s, at least one `0`, and at least one `1`.

## 我的方法

我的方法是，首先创建一个数组index_1来记录seats中所有1的下标，然后遍历这个index_1数组，获得两个1之间的最大间隔，最终的结果就是该最大间隔除以2。这种方法需要注意的是，在index_1数组建立完成后，需要在其开头和结尾分别补元素，否则面对原seats中开头和结尾不是1的情况就会出错。补元素的方法是：开头补-index_1[0]，结尾补2*l-1-index_1[-1]，即如果原seats中开头或结尾是0，那么想象开头位置的左边和它右边1等距离的位置有一个1；结尾的右边和其左边1等距离的位置有一个1。

```python
class Solution:
    def maxDistToClosest(self, seats: List[int]) -> int:
        l = len(seats)
        index_1 = []
        max_dis = 0
        for i in range(l):
            if seats[i] == 1:
                index_1.append(i)
                
        index_1.insert(0,-index_1[0])
        index_1.append(2*l-1-index_1[-1])
        
        for i in range(1,len(index_1)):
            if index_1[i]-index_1[i-1] > max_dis:
                max_dis = index_1[i]-index_1[i-1]
                
        return max_dis//2
```
