# 题目

Say you have an array for which the *i*th element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

## 我的思路

首先，创建一个二维数组可以直接解决问题，但这样显然不是最优的解法。仔细捋了一遍这一题的计算过程，发现可以用O(n)的时间复杂度解决：建立两个值，一个res存放结果，一个temp存放买入股票的价格。首先令买入股票的价格为prices[0]，然后遍历prices，若当前值大于temp，则计算股票差价，若差价大于res则更新res；若当前值小于temp，则把当前值存为新的temp，然后继续下一轮循环。循环结束后res即为所求。

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        if not prices:
            return 0
        temp = prices[0]
        res = 0
        for i in range(1,len(prices)):
            if prices[i] > temp:
                s = prices[i] - temp
                if s > res:
                    res = s
                continue
            else:
                temp = prices[i]
                continue
                
        return res             
```
